Employee Attrition Prediction Model
This project is a neural network model designed to predict employee attrition based on various features related to employee satisfaction, department, and work-related factors. The goal is to identify employees likely to leave the company, which can help improve retention strategies.

Overview
The model consists of two branches:

Department Branch: Processes data specific to the employeeâ€™s department.
Attrition Branch: Processes general features related to employee attrition.
The outputs of both branches are combined in the final layer, which gives a binary prediction for employee attrition.

Key Details
Input Data: Includes employee information such as age, department, job role, satisfaction levels, and more.
Architecture: Two branches with hidden layers, followed by a combined layer for final prediction.
Output: A probability indicating the likelihood of employee attrition, where values close to 1 indicate higher risk.
Model Performance
Accuracy: The model achieved ~87% accuracy on the test data.
Evaluation Metrics: Although accuracy was used, metrics like precision and recall may be more insightful if class imbalance exists.
Possible Improvements
Feature Engineering: Add more meaningful features to improve predictions.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with batch size, learning rate, and regularization to optimize performance.
Model Complexity: Add more hidden layers or increase neurons to capture complex relationships.
Usage
Training: The model is trained on a dataset with features and target labels for attrition.
Evaluation: Evaluated on a separate test set to check for accuracy and generalization.
This project provides a simple yet powerful way to help companies predict and manage employee turnover effectively.
